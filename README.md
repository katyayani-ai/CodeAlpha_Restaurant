# CodeAlpha_Restaurant
This project is a **restaurant management system** that allows users to view the menu, reserve tables, and place orders. The application is built using **Django**, a popular web framework for building web applications quickly and efficiently.

In the application, users can navigate through various pages. The **home page** welcomes users and provides links to the **menu** and **reservation** pages. The **menu page** displays a list of delicious dishes available at the restaurant, while the **reservation page** allows users to reserve a table by providing their name, reservation date, and table number.

To enhance the user experience, the application features a simple yet attractive design with CSS styles. The project is structured with separate templates for each page, making it easy to manage and update.

To run the project, ensure you have Django installed and set up the database. After running the server, you can access the application at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**. 

Feel free to explore and enjoy using this restaurant management system!
